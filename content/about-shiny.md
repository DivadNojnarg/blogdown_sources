  ## Introduction
  
All my previous shiny apps are dedicated to special models and features tighly depend on model properties. Thus, came the idea of making a shiny app which will be able to read any 2D model, drawing the phase plane and making a stability analysis. The following app is a first step toward a much more sofisticated one, and is of course still in development. <br/>
